## Tips
Subtree deletion and insertion may require traversing and moving a large number of nodes, so you need to be extra careful when designing the storage method of children, and control the complexity within the cost range.
Be careful to avoid traversing all children when maintaining height and subtree size.


1. size of tree is the number of nodes
2. height of tree is the height of its root node
   1. height of a node is the number of edgest on the longest path from node to a leaf
